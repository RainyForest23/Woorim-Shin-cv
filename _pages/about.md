I am Woorim Shin, an undergraduate student of Computer Science and Engineering at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, South Korea.

I'm passionate about **Natural Language Processing** and **Korean Language Technology**, currently diving deep into AI/ML through hands-on projects while building up the theoretical foundations. My journey has been driven by curiosity and a determination to tackle challenges until I find solutions – when I get fascinated by a field, I tend to dive deep and explore every aspect of it.

Recently, I led the end-to-end development of an **AI subtitle generation model for Korean educational content**. Through this project, I gained comprehensive experience in:
- **Model Development**: Fine-tuning Whisper models with LoRA and PEFT techniques
- **Infrastructure**: Setting up distributed GPU training environments and monitoring with Tensorboard  
- **NLP Engineering**: Building RAG systems, Korean embeddings, and custom tokenizers
- **MLOps Pipeline**: Automating evaluation and review processes using Google Apps Script
- **Project Management**: Streamlining review workflows and coordinating cross-functional teams

This experience sparked my deep interest in **MLOps**, **AI Engineering**, and the intersection of **natural language processing with real-world applications**. I'm particularly drawn to solving practical problems through AI technology, especially in educational and language processing domains.

As an undergraduate still learning and growing, I'm eager to contribute to meaningful projects while continuing to expand my knowledge. I believe the best way to learn is by doing, and I'm always ready to take on new challenges that push me to grow both technically and personally.

Feel free to connect with me for research collaborations, internship opportunities, or discussions about AI/NLP projects!
