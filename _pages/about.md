I am Woorim Shin, an undergraduate student of Computer Science and Engineering at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, South Korea.

I specialize in **Natural Language Processing** and **Korean Language Technology**, with hands-on experience in fine-tuning large language models, building automated speech recognition systems, and developing data analysis pipelines. My research interests focus on applying AI technologies to educational domains, particularly in Korean language processing.

I have worked on various projects ranging from **Korean educational ASR systems** using fine-tuned Whisper models to **automated text analysis platforms** for educational content. I'm passionate about leveraging machine learning and data science to solve real-world problems in education and language technology.

Feel free to connect with me for research collaborations, internship opportunities, or discussions about AI and NLP projects.
